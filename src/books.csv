174,x,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,9.2,2019,20,"While a work of non-fiction, this reads like a masterfully composed novel. Larson’s incredibly detailed descriptions of weather, clothing, and interactions gave me a sense of being on the ship from the moment it left port in Manhattan to the moment the last radio antenna dipped below the surface of the Celtic Sea.","Any other man would have found this scene terrifying. Brooks was entranced. He saw the body of the torpedo moving well ahead of the wake, through water he described as being ‘a beautiful green.’ The torpedo ‘was covered with a silvery phosphorescence, you might term it, which was caused by the air escaping from the motors.’ He said, ‘It was a beautiful sight.’",History,2015,Erik Larson,

167,x,Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong,9.1,2019,14,"Loewen asserts that American history textbooks, rather than teach American history, serve essentially to create nationalist citizens who are taught not to think critically, that America is the greatest republic in the history of the world, and that our country has done no wrong. ","Of course the people do not want war...But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy.

165,x,Beowulf: Translation & Commentary,8.1,2019,12,"I don’t doubt that this poem was more transformative than most books I’ve read.
